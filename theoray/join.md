### In MySQL, the JOIN operation is used to combine rows from two or more tables based on a related column between them. There are different types of JOINs:

1. **INNER JOIN:**
   - Retrieves records that have matching values in both tables.
   - Syntax: `SELECT * FROM table1 INNER JOIN table2 ON table1.column_name = table2.column_name;`

2. **LEFT JOIN (or LEFT OUTER JOIN):**
   - Retrieves all records from the left table and the matched records from the right table. If there's no match in the right table, it returns NULL.
   - Syntax: `SELECT * FROM table1 LEFT JOIN table2 ON table1.column_name = table2.column_name;`

3. **RIGHT JOIN (or RIGHT OUTER JOIN):**
   - Retrieves all records from the right table and the matched records from the left table. If there's no match in the left table, it returns NULL.
   - Syntax: `SELECT * FROM table1 RIGHT JOIN table2 ON table1.column_name = table2.column_name;`

4. **FULL JOIN (or FULL OUTER JOIN):**
   - Retrieves all records when there's a match in either the left or the right table.
   - Syntax: `SELECT * FROM table1 FULL JOIN table2 ON table1.column_name = table2.column_name;`

5. **CROSS JOIN:**
   - Retrieves the Cartesian product of both tables (every combination of rows from both tables).
   - Syntax: `SELECT * FROM table1 CROSS JOIN table2;`

# inner join types

1. **Natural Join:**
   - A `NATURAL JOIN` is a type of JOIN that automatically performs the join operation based on columns that have the same name in both tables.
   - It joins the tables by selecting columns with the same name in both tables.
   - Syntax: 
     ```sql
     SELECT * FROM table1 NATURAL JOIN table2;
     ```

2. **Self Join:**
   - A `SELF JOIN` is used to join a table to itself, typically to compare rows within the same table.
   - It requires aliasing the table names to differentiate between the two instances of the same table.
   - Syntax:
     ```sql
     SELECT a.column, b.column
     FROM table a
     JOIN table b ON a.some_column = b.some_column;
     ```
3. **Non-Equi Join:**
   - A `NON-EQUI JOIN` is a join that uses a comparison operator other than the equality operator (i.e., `!=`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`) to join tables.
   - It's used when there is no simple equality relationship between the columns in the tables being joined.
   - Syntax:
     ```sql
     SELECT * FROM table1, table2 WHERE table1.column > table2.column;
     ```
