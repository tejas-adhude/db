In MySQL, a cursor is a database object that allows for the traversal and manipulation of the result set returned by a SQL query. Cursors provide an efficient way to work with individual rows returned by a SELECT statement, enabling navigation through the result set one row at a time.

MySQL supports two main types of cursors:

1. **Implicit Cursor:** This is the default cursor type in MySQL. When you execute a SELECT query in MySQL, the result set is automatically retrieved and processed. You don't explicitly declare or manage an implicit cursor; it is automatically created and managed by the MySQL server.

   Example of an implicit cursor:

   ```sql
   SELECT column1, column2 FROM table_name;
   ```

2. **Explicit Cursor:** Explicit cursors are created by the user through the `DECLARE`, `OPEN`, `FETCH`, and `CLOSE` statements. These cursors provide more control over the result set traversal, allowing you to fetch rows one by one, process them, and close the cursor when done.

   Basic syntax for using explicit cursors:

   ```sql
   DECLARE cursor_name CURSOR FOR SELECT column1, column2 FROM table_name;
   OPEN cursor_name;
   FETCH cursor_name INTO variable1, variable2;
   -- Process the fetched data or loop through fetching more rows
   CLOSE cursor_name;
   ```
