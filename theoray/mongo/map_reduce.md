Certainly! In MongoDB, the Map-Reduce function is used to process and analyze data across a collection. It involves two primary stages: the map stage and the reduce stage.

### Map Stage:
The map stage is where you define a JavaScript function that processes each document in the collection and emits key-value pairs. This function is applied to every document in the collection.

Here's an example of a simple map function in MongoDB:

```javascript
var mapFunction = function() {
    emit(this.type, this.amount);
};
```

This function maps each document by emitting a key-value pair where the key is the 'type' field and the value is the 'amount' field.

### Reduce Stage:
The reduce stage is another JavaScript function that processes the key-value pairs generated by the map function. It takes the output of the map function and condenses it by combining the values of the same key.

```javascript
var reduceFunction = function(key, values) {
    return Array.sum(values);
};
```

This reduce function sums up all the values associated with the same key.

### Executing Map-Reduce in MongoDB:
You can execute the map-reduce operation using the `mapReduce()` function in MongoDB. Here's how you might execute it:

```javascript
db.yourCollection.mapReduce(
    mapFunction,
    reduceFunction,
    {
        out: "outputCollection" // Specify the collection where results will be stored
    }
);
```

This will run the map and reduce functions on your collection, and the results will be stored in the specified output collection.

### Example:

Suppose you have a collection named 'transactions' with documents having fields 'type' and 'amount':

```javascript
// Sample data in 'transactions' collection
{ "type": "deposit", "amount": 500 }
{ "type": "withdrawal", "amount": 200 }
{ "type": "deposit", "amount": 300 }
{ "type": "withdrawal", "amount": 100 }
```

Applying map-reduce on this collection:

```javascript
var mapFunction = function() {
    emit(this.type, this.amount);
};

var reduceFunction = function(key, values) {
    return Array.sum(values);
};

db.transactions.mapReduce(
    mapFunction,
    reduceFunction,
    { out: "transactionTotals" }
);
```

This will create a new collection named 'transactionTotals' containing the result of the map-reduce operation, where the keys are the transaction types ("deposit", "withdrawal") and the values are the total amounts associated with each type.
